# KilonovaML
The final, and generally clearer repository for the code necessary to generate kilonova lightcurves using normalised flow machine learning.

The Basic process is described in the chart below. Data must be presented to the Training programme whole and without nan values. I was able to create the DU17 model effectively using code within the gwemligthcurve package and a similair approach should work for other models in which case *hopeully* we can just change the data at the beginning and the rest of the process will follow as it has before.
